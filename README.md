# Zombie Survival Game
Using Pygame, I created a 2D shooter where the player's goal is to stay alive as long as possible. The player can kill zombies by shooting them however, each one is unique! If the player ever collides with a zombie, they die and the game ends so make sure you eliminate them. Hope you have fun playing!
