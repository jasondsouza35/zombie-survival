# Zombie Survival
This is the first game I ever coded. Using Pygame, I created a 2D shooter where the player attempts to stay alive as long as possible. You get a gun and shooting the zombies will kill them however, each one is unique, some are fast and weak while others might be slow and tanky! If the character ever collides with a zombie the game ends. Hope you have as much fun playing this game as I did making it!
